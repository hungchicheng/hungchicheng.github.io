# Welcome to Jekyll!
# This is the default format. 
# For more see: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/

# Themes are encouraged to use these universal variables 
# so be sure to set them if your theme uses them.
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that.
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
title: Hung-Chi's Blog
url: "http://hungchicheng.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog

# The url is only used when full-domain names are needed
# such as sitemap.txt 
# Most places will/should use BASE_PATH to make the urls
#
# If you have set a CNAME (pages.github.com) set your custom domain here.
# Else if you are pushing to username.github.io, replace with your username.
# Finally if you are pushing to a GitHub project page, include the project name at the end.
